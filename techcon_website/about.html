            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>TechCon Africa was founded in 2015 by a group of visionary engineers in Nairobi, Kenya, with the mission of bridging the digital divide across the continent. What began as a small gathering of 200 developers has since grown into Africaâ€™s premier tech event, attracting over 10,000 attendees annually. The conference gained global recognition in 2018 after hosting a groundbreaking keynote by AI pioneer Dr. Amina Diallo, who unveiled an open-source language model for Swahili and Yoruba. In 2021, TechCon expanded to include satellite events in Lagos, Cape Town, and Cairo, fostering pan-African collaboration in fintech, AI, and renewable energy. Known for its "Code for Impact" hackathons, TechCon has incubated over 50 startups that have collectively raised $200 million in funding. The 2024 edition made history by becoming the first carbon-neutral tech conference in Africa, powered entirely by solar energy and virtual attendance options.</p>
